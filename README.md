# Tag Stack

This is inspired by [TagStudio](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio). It's also an opportunity for me to try out electron and tauri(which in turn means Rust) via a project.

This repo contains two folders, `electron` and `tauri` which houses the electron and tauri version of this project in the respective folders. More instructions on how to build and run are in those folders.
